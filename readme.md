3\. Interface
=============

### 3.1 API Interface

The API interface in our project acts as the intermediary between the frontend application and the backend API server. It defines the endpoints, request methods, and data formats for communication. Through this interface, our frontend can make requests to the server to fetch or manipulate data related to Netflix, Disney and TMDb.

### 3.2 Database Interface

Our database interface facilitates seamless communication between the API server and the underlying database system. It handles tasks such as storing and retrieving data related to streaming content, user preferences, and statistical information. This interface ensures efficient data management and persistence within our system.

### 3.3 User Interface

The user interface (UI) is the primary point of interaction between our platform and its users. It presents the fetched data from Netflix, Disney, and TMDb in a visually appealing and intuitive manner, allowing users to explore and interact with the content seamlessly. Our UI design prioritizes usability, accessibility, and responsiveness to deliver an exceptional user experience.

### 3.4 Third-Party APIs and local APIs

Our system interfaces with third-party APIs provided by TMDb to access poster-photos.The local APIs are used to recive the information such as duration, rating and genre for each.

### 3.5 Export Interface

The export interface in our project empowers users to export statistics and visualizations generated by the system in various formats, including CSV, WebP, and SVG. This functionality enhances data portability and allows users to share or analyze data outside of our platform. Our export interface offers customization options to tailor the exported data to users' specific needs.

### 3.6 Search and Filter Interface

Our search and filter interface provides users with robust tools to refine and narrow down the dataset based on specific criteria. Users can perform multi-criteria searches, apply filters, and sort results to find relevant streaming content efficiently. This interface enhances user productivity and aids in discovering insights within the vast dataset available on our platform.

These interfaces will ensure that the system is modular, scalable, and maintainable, and can be easily integrated with other systems and services.
